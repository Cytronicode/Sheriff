## Cloning the repository onto your local system

**Node.js 16.9.0 or newer is required.**

```sh-session
$ git clone https://github.com/Cytronicode/sheriff.git
```

Note that if you want to base your own bot off of this repository, you need to rename the `config-example.json` file to `config.json` and add the guild ID and client ID. Additionally, note that **the bot token is an environment variable**, so there is also a need for you to create a local `.env` file.
